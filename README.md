## LITA offered me an admission on Data Analysis. We started with Excel, follow by SQL. My applied practicals are documented here.
## PROJECT TITLE: Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Querying using Excel and SQL

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to clean and structure a raw data set using Excel for initial organization, perform data summarization and insights using pivot tables, and conduct advanced querying for analysis using SQL. The cleaned dataset, summarized in Excel using some excel functions including conditional functions; pivot tables and further analyzed with SQL queries, provides insights into trends, patterns, and outliers. The project delivers actionable recommendations based on the analysis to assist in data-driven decision-making.

## Data Source
The data set was given by our tutors in persons of Mr Mushin and Mr Femi. Also, data was gotten from site such as kaggle

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

- SQL - Structured Query Language for Quering data and Data manipulation

### Introduction to SQL 

- SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
- It is used for storing and managing data in Relational Database 
Management System (RDBMS).
- It is a standard language for Relational Database System. It enables 
a user to relate databases and tables. 
- All the RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS Access, and 
SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.
- SQL allows users to query the database in a number of ways, using 
English-like statements

### What are the SQL?

#### SQL follows the following rules: 
- Structure query language is not case sensitive. Generally, keywords of SQL are written in uppercase. 
- Statements of SQL are dependent on text lines. We can use a single SQL statement on one or multiple text line. 
- Using the SQL statements, you can perform most of the actions in a database. 
- SQL depends on tuple relational calculus and relational algebra

## What is the Databases

A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a structured way to allow for easy access, 
retrieval, and manipulation.

#### Advantage of Databases:
- Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
- Security: Protects data from unauthorized access and breaches.
- Backup and Recovery: Allows data to be recovered in case of loss or corruption.
- Concurrency: Supports multiple users accessing the database simultaneously.
- Scalability: Ability to handle increasing amounts of data and users without performance degradation.
- Efficient Data Management: Databases are optimized for quick access to large volumes of data, enabling fast retrieval 
of information through queries

## How Databases Store Data

Databases store data in a structured format using tables, which are composed of rows and columns. Each table 
represents a specific type of data, and each row (or record) in the table represents a single entry, such as a customer or 
transaction. The columns (or fields) define the attributes of the data, such as a customerâ€™s name, age, or account 
number.

- If you have used Excel, you should already be familiar with tables
- Tables have rows and columns just like Excel.
- Database tables for instance are organized by column
- Each column must have a unique name, 
- You will notice, that some columns contain numbers, while other contain texts. In a spreadsheet, each cell can have 
its own data types.
- But in databases tables, all the data in a column must be of the same type.
- This makes performing analysis on database tables pretty simples, while the data type must be consistent
